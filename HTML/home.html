     Sam 23 Engineer: "Taniti Island has been an amazing experience. The resort I stayed at had many 
    accommodations for US citizens considering the island being a mediator of a lot of nations. 10/10 I 
    recomend any to visit the island."

    medical perfessionals I am apart of wanted to meet in a warmer climate surrounded by water. Taniti Island has everything we 
    wanted at an afforable price. 9/10 would reccomend for anyone."</p>
